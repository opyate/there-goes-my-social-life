TODO:

* Mapper inheritance - address -> user/venue addresses
Once we've established how to do it, remember to add "is_billing" to the "user" version of the address table.
-OR- just use "is_billing" for venue addresses, but ignore it.

* scala+liftweb payment APIs
* user roles ('type' as per db schema diagram)

* find out if MappedDecimal or MappedDouble is better to represent monetary amounts.
* possibly use MappedEnum/MappedEnumList for lists of constant stuff, like countries.
* does ProtoUser have a MappedLocale?
* perhaps use a MappedTimezone for a venue, in case the user books a venue from the other side of the world.
